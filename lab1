### Lab 1: **Simple Interest Calculator**

**Objective:**  
Create a program that calculates the simple interest for a given principal, rate of interest, and time period.

**Instructions:**
1. Prompt the user to input the principal amount (P), rate of interest (R), and the time period in years (T).
2. Use the formula for simple interest:  
   \[
   \text{Simple Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
   \]
3. Store the calculated simple interest in a variable.
4. Display the calculated interest using `print()`.

**Example Input/Output:**
```
Enter the principal amount: 1000
Enter the rate of interest: 5
Enter the time period (in years): 2
The simple interest is: 100.0
```
p = int(input("what is the principle amount? ")
print("1000*2/5")
answer = ((p*R*t)/(100))
print(f"The simple interest is: {answer}")
answer= 


### Lab 2: **Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator**

**Objective:**  
Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height.

**Instructions:**
1. Ask the user to input their weight in kilograms (kg) and height in meters (m).
2. Use the formula to calculate BMI:  
   \[
   \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2}
   \]
3. Store the result in a variable.
4. Output the calculated BMI using `print()`. Also, display a message indicating whether the BMI falls within a healthy range (18.5 - 24.9).

**Example Input/Output:**
```
Enter your weight (kg): 70
Enter your height (m): 1.75
Your BMI is: 22.86
You are within the healthy BMI range.
```
kg = int(input("what is your weight?"))
m = int(input("what is your heaight?"))
BMI = (22.86) # you are in a healthy BMI range
print(f"the weight and height is: {BMI}")

### Lab 3: **Temperature Converter (Celsius to Fahrenheit)**

**Objective:**  
Create a program that converts a temperature given in Celsius to Fahrenheit.

**Instructions:**
1. Prompt the user to enter the temperature in Celsius.
2. Use the conversion formula:  
   \[
   \text{Fahrenheit} = (\text{Celsius} \times 9/5) + 32
   \]
3. Store the result in a variable.
4. Print the temperature in Fahrenheit.

**Example Input/Output:**
```
Enter the temperature in Celsius: 25
The temperature in Fahrenheit is: 77.0
``
celsius = int(input("temptrature in celsius")
fahrenheit = int(input("from celsius to fahrenheit")
answer = 77.0 # this is answer of temprature from celsius to fahrenheit
print(f"temprature from cesius to fahrenheit is: {answer}")
